# Roblox Desktop App Prompt Remover
 
I was tired of closing the banner manually so I decided to create an extension that would do the job for me.

# How to install?
1. Download this repository as a zip file. (Code tab > Download ZIP)
2. Unpack the zip file to a folder of your choosing (outside Download folder to avoid deleting it by accident)
3. Head to __chrome://extensions__
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click __Load unpacked__
6. Select the folder you extracted the zip to.
7. It should be installed.

# How to use?
The extension will remove the annoying banner everytime you visit either __www.roblox.com__ or __web.roblox.com__ (for accounts with age under 13)

If you are having any problem with the extension. Make sure to let me know.
